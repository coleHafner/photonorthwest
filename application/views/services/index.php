	       My goal as a photographer is to capture memories in the making.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	       Senior portraits reflect personal touches such as an instrument, sports equipment, special car,
	       or favorite place.  Family events show the bringing together of generations, new additions, and
	       old friends.  Your wedding, a special day with close family and friends, beautiful dress, flowers,
	       the cake. All the things you should remember about any special event can be captured in a photograph.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	       As an experienced photojournalist capturing the real moments of any special event brings a touch of
	       personality and a good story to your photos. As a developing photographer I take time with details and
	       special moments to create unique photographs as well as traditional ones.
